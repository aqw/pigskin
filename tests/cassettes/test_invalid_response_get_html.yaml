        \     Availing himself of the mild, summer-cool weather that now reigned in\
        \ these latitudes, and in preparation for the peculiarly active pursuits shortly\
        \ to be anticipated, Perth, the begrimed, blistered old blacksmith, had not\
        \ removed his portable forge to the hold again, after concluding his contributory\
        \ work for Ahab's leg, but still retained it on deck, fast lashed to ringbolts\
        \ by the foremast; being now almost incessantly invoked by the headsmen, and\
        \ harpooneers, and bowsmen to do some little job for them; altering, or repairing,\
        \ or new shaping their various weapons and boat furniture. Often he would\
        \ be surrounded by an eager circle, all waiting to be served; holding boat-spades,\
        \ pike-heads, harpoons, and lances, and jealously watching his every sooty\
        \ movement, as he toiled. Nevertheless, this old man's was a patient hammer\
        \ wielded by a patient arm. No murmur, no impatience, no petulance did come\
        \ from him. Silent, slow, and solemn; bowing over still further his chronically\
        \ broken back, he toiled away, as if toil were life itself, and the heavy\
        \ beating of his hammer the heavy beating of his heart. And so it was.\u2014\
        Most miserable! A peculiar walk in this old man, a certain slight but painful\
        \ appearing yawing in his gait, had at an early period of the voyage excited\
        \ the curiosity of the mariners. And to the importunity of their persisted\
        \ questionings he had finally given in; and so it came to pass that every\
        \ one now knew the shameful story of his wretched fate. Belated, and not innocently,\
        \ one bitter winter's midnight, on the road running between two country towns,\
        \ the blacksmith half-stupidly felt the deadly numbness stealing over him,\
        \ and sought refuge in a leaning, dilapidated barn. The issue was, the loss\
        \ of the extremities of both feet. Out of this revelation, part by part, at\
        \ last came out the four acts of the gladness, and the one long, and as yet\
        \ uncatastrophied fifth act of the grief of his life's drama. He was an old\
        \ man, who, at the age of nearly sixty, had postponedly encountered that thing\
        \ in sorrow's technicals called ruin. He had been an artisan of famed excellence,\
        \ and with plenty to do; owned a house and garden; embraced a youthful, daughter-like,\
        \ loving wife, and three blithe, ruddy children; every Sunday went to a cheerful-looking\
        \ church, planted in a grove. But one night, under cover of darkness, and\
        \ further concealed in a most cunning disguisement, a desperate burglar slid\
        \ into his happy home, and robbed them all of everything. And darker yet to\
        \ tell, the blacksmith himself did ignorantly conduct this burglar into his\
        \ family's heart. It was the Bottle Conjuror! Upon the opening of that fatal\
        \ cork, forth flew the fiend, and shrivelled up his home. Now, for prudent,\
        \ most wise, and economic reasons, the blacksmith's shop was in the basement\
        \ of his dwelling, but with a separate entrance to it; so that always had\
        \ the young and loving healthy wife listened with no unhappy nervousness,\
        \ but with vigorous pleasure, to the stout ringing of her young-armed old\
        \ husband's hammer; whose reverberations, muffled by passing through the floors\
        \ and walls, came up to her, not unsweetly, in her nursery; and so, to stout\
        \ Labor's iron lullaby, the blacksmith's infants were rocked to slumber. Oh,\
        \ woe on woe! Oh, Death, why canst thou not sometimes be timely? Hadst thou\
        \ taken this old blacksmith to thyself ere his full ruin came upon him, then\
        \ had the young widow had a delicious grief, and her orphans a truly venerable,\
        \ legendary sire to dream of in their after years; and all of them a care-killing\

        \ work for Ahab's leg, but still retained it on deck, fast lashed to ringbolts\
        \ by the foremast; being now almost incessantly invoked by the headsmen, and\
        \ harpooneers, and bowsmen to do some little job for them; altering, or repairing,\
        \ or new shaping their various weapons and boat furniture. Often he would\
        \ be surrounded by an eager circle, all waiting to be served; holding boat-spades,\
        \ pike-heads, harpoons, and lances, and jealously watching his every sooty\
        \ movement, as he toiled. Nevertheless, this old man's was a patient hammer\
        \ wielded by a patient arm. No murmur, no impatience, no petulance did come\
        \ from him. Silent, slow, and solemn; bowing over still further his chronically\
        \ broken back, he toiled away, as if toil were life itself, and the heavy\
        \ beating of his hammer the heavy beating of his heart. And so it was.\u2014\
        Most miserable! A peculiar walk in this old man, a certain slight but painful\
        \ appearing yawing in his gait, had at an early period of the voyage excited\
        \ the curiosity of the mariners. And to the importunity of their persisted\
        \ questionings he had finally given in; and so it came to pass that every\
        \ one now knew the shameful story of his wretched fate. Belated, and not innocently,\
        \ one bitter winter's midnight, on the road running between two country towns,\
        \ the blacksmith half-stupidly felt the deadly numbness stealing over him,\
        \ and sought refuge in a leaning, dilapidated barn. The issue was, the loss\
        \ of the extremities of both feet. Out of this revelation, part by part, at\
        \ last came out the four acts of the gladness, and the one long, and as yet\
        \ uncatastrophied fifth act of the grief of his life's drama. He was an old\
        \ man, who, at the age of nearly sixty, had postponedly encountered that thing\
        \ in sorrow's technicals called ruin. He had been an artisan of famed excellence,\
        \ and with plenty to do; owned a house and garden; embraced a youthful, daughter-like,\
        \ loving wife, and three blithe, ruddy children; every Sunday went to a cheerful-looking\

        \ further concealed in a most cunning disguisement, a desperate burglar slid\
        \ into his happy home, and robbed them all of everything. And darker yet to\
        \ tell, the blacksmith himself did ignorantly conduct this burglar into his\
        \ family's heart. It was the Bottle Conjuror! Upon the opening of that fatal\
        \ cork, forth flew the fiend, and shrivelled up his home. Now, for prudent,\
